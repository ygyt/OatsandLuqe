    This website is dedicated to the most special person ever in the HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLE world to me haha sorry but really 
    you are something else BUT YOU KNOW in a good way haha you might not be the best at Overwatch haha but if you were, I would have never found you. That sounds a bit bad haha, but I stayed on that stream that day because for some reason it
    just felt different with you. I don't know how to say it, but you were not like the other streamers, and I got to find out that you are not like 
    anyone else. You are different; you chose to care, and you chose to stay through everything. So thank you for staying with me ðŸ˜Œ. I don't know what that emoji is act like it's not there haha. I hope you enjoy everything I put into this site ðŸ¥°.
